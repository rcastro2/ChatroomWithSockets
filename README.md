Chatroom with Sockets
==============

Project explores how to use web sockets to communicate using a chatroom as the motivation.  The project includes node and python servers as well as Javascript and React clients.

Instructions
1) You must run the appropriate commands to install the socket.io libraries for the node server, python servers and React client. The Javascript client directly links to the library.

2) Once everything is installed you must run one of the servers.  Pay attention to the port being used.

3) Start at least one of the clients. Ensure the connection instruction matches the server to include the proper port.

Happy chatting.
